                        <ul>
                            <li>This program is designed to help players identify champions by lane roles—Top, Mid, Jungle, ADC (Bottom), and Support—and make informed choices based on several factors: champion difficulty, cost (in Blue Essence or RP), preferred lane, and performance metrics like KDA (Kill/Death/Assist ratio). While it won’t guarantee victory, the analysis and visualizations provided will offer deeper insights into champion stats and help you choose champions that fit your playstyle.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                            <li>A simple form designed to collect an individual's favorite items, ranging from colors to numbers. This project was an exercise to help me become more familiar with HTML and CSS.</li>

                            <li>Investigate the correlation between higher education levels and home ownership. This project utilized Pandas to organize the data. We gathered, cleaned, and structured the data, then created visualizations to highlight the relationship between higher education and home ownership.</li>
