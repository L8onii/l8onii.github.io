                    <li>This program is designed to help players identify champions by lane roles—Top, Mid, Jungle, ADC (Bottom), and Support—and make informed choices based on several factors: champion difficulty, cost (in Blue Essence or RP), preferred lane, and performance metrics like KDA (Kill/Death/Assist ratio). While it won’t guarantee victory, the analysis and visualizations provided will offer deeper insights into champion stats and help you choose champions that fit your playstyle.</li>

This project utilized SQL to collect data by zip code in order to identify any correlations between obesity and the presence of fast food establishments. We then cleaned the data to ensure it was relevant to our study. Finally, we created visualizations to make the findings easily interpretable for others.</li>
